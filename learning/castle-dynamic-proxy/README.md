# Learning - Castle Dynamic Proxy

Dynamic Proxy creates a transparent proxy for the real object at runtime for us, and we can intercept the calls to it, and add logic to the objects.

what we want to achieve:

- be able to use non-frozen freezable object just like any other object
- be able to check if the object is freezable
- be able to check if the object is frozen
- be able to freeze freezable object
- NOT be able to change state of the object after it has been frozen

A few points that would be useful to keep in mind:
- Each proxy generated by Castle Dynamic Proxy framework implements an `IProxyTargetAccessor` interface
- `IProxyGenerationHook` helps with how proxies are created.
-  DynamicProxy not allows you to intercept `System.Object`’s (or `System.MarshalByRefObject`’s) methods, unless they’re overridden in the proxy type (or in any of its base types)
